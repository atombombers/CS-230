- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

   To expand its customer reach, social media company Chat Away planned to develop a mobile app version of its website. The app had to be available on both the
  Android and iPhone app stores. Staying within the set budget and timeline was a top priority for the project.

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I believe I effectively assessed the strengths and weaknesses of each potential solution. This would help provide informed decision-making to the company.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

   I found that taking time to explore different options early on was really helpful. Mapping out the possible directions and weighing what each one adds or takes away gave me a better understanding of the project. 
   The hardest part was knowing when I'd explored enough and it was time to start building.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

   I believe I may have overlooked a few important factors when evaluating the different platforms, especially security, which is critical to the success of the application. Secure coding practices
  and overall security considerations should have been a top priority and not something I missed. I feel like this may largely be due to my inexperience.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

   If you’re not meeting your users’ needs, they’ll leave the moment something better comes along. On top of that, you have to keep finding ways to wow them if you want even your most loyal users to stick around.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

   I approached designing the software by first breaking down the client and user needs and outlining the core features required. From there, I mapped out different design options and weighed their 
   pros and cons before choosing a solution for the client. In future real scenarios, I’d like to be given the opportunity to spend time validating my ideas early on through user feedback and prototypes 
   to make sure the design truly fits the client and users' expectations.
